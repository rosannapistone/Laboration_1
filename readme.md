Game Of The Sea takes the user for an unforgettable journey under the water. The user will be offered to do different types of tasks. By clicking the buttons the user continue the journey and finally reach the end of the adventure.

By using onclick functions the program runs forward. The first view is developted in the the files: index.html and style.css. The further development takes action in the JavaScript file, main.js. In the .js file elements are reachable by theirs id by using document.getElementById and new elements like buttons, inputs, textareas and divs are created by using document.creatElement. 

All the styling and content like innerHTML is edited in .js wich is possible because of the actions described above. 

Images and background images are declared in the top of the .js file and replaces the initial background in almost every function.  

SetInterval and setTimeout are used to add some action points in the program for the user.
